Hello, my name is Zhipeng Yin. I am a Ph.D. candidate at the Knight Foundation School of Computing and Information Sciences (KFSCIS) at Florida International University, fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://users.cs.fiu.edu/~wbzhang/">Dr. Wenbin Zhang</a>, whose expertise lies in Reliable AI.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
My research centers on <code>trustworthy AI, with a particular focus on algorithmic fairness, reliability, interpretability, as well as the intricate copyright and intellectual property challenges brought by generative models</code>.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Along my academic journey, I have been honored with the <a href="https://ecmlpkdd.org/2025/awards/">ECML-PKDD 2025 Best Student Paper Award</a>. Thanks to my advisor, my academic lineage traces to Paul Erdős, giving me an Erdős number of 4 (me->Wenbin Zhang->Alan Evans->David Avis->Erdős)—a small, personal testament to the spirit of interdisciplinary collaboration.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Before entering academia, I worked as a software engineer and game developer. One of my most rewarding projects was contributing to <a href="https://www.rivergame.net/en/default.html?1648441890461">Top War</a>, a game now enjoyed by over `100 million` players worldwide. Outside of research and coding, I am an avid photographer drawn to the beauty of nature, capturing sunrises, sunsets and starry skies to tell visual stories through my lens.
</p>

Thank you for stopping by to read a little bit about me. Whether you’re interested in research, tech, or just want to share a favorite photo spot, I hope you’ll reach out—after all, every conversation is the start of a new story.
