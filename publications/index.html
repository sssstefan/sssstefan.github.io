Despite these advancements, LMs can inherit and amplify societal biases related to sensitive attributes such as gender and race, limiting their adoption in real-world applications. Therefore, fairness has been extensively explored in LMs, leading to the proposal of various fairness notions. However, the lack of clear agreement on which fairness definition to apply in specific contexts and the complexity of understanding the distinctions between these definitions can create confusion and impede further progress. To this end, this paper proposes a systematic survey that clarifies the definitions of fairness as they apply to LMs. Specifically, we begin with a brief introduction to LMs and fairness in LMs, followed by a comprehensive, up-to-date overview of existing fairness notions in LMs and the introduction of a novel taxonomy that categorizes these concepts based on their transformer architecture: encoder-only, decoder-only, and encoder-decoder LMs. We further illustrate each definition through experiments, showcasing their practical implications and outcomes. Finally, we discuss current research challenges and open questions, aiming to foster innovative ideas and advance the field.

However, the inherent biases in AI algorithms hinder this improvement by unintentionally perpetuating prejudice against specific demographics, especially in human-centered applications like education. This survey delves deeply into the developing topic of algorithmic fairness in educational contexts, providing a comprehensive evaluation of the diverse literature on fairness, bias, and ethics in AI-driven educational applications. It identifies the common forms of biases, such as data-related, algorithmic, and user-interaction, that fundamentally undermine the accomplishment of fairness in AI teaching aids. By outlining existing techniques for mitigating these biases, ranging from varied data gathering to algorithmic fairness interventions, the survey emphasizes the critical role of ethical considerations and legal frameworks in shaping a more equitable educational environment. Furthermore, it guides readers through the complexities of fairness measurements, methods, and datasets, shedding light on the way to bias reduction. Despite these gains, this survey highlights long-standing issues, such as achieving a balance between fairness and accuracy, as well as the need for diverse datasets. Overcoming these challenges and ensuring the ethical and fair use of AI’s promise in education call for a collaborative, interdisciplinary approach.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div id="wang2025fg" class="col-sm-10"> <div class="title">Fg-smote: Towards fair node classification with graph neural network</div> <div class="author"> Zichong Wang, <em>Zhipeng Yin</em>, Yuying Zhang, Liping Yang, Tingting Zhang, Niki Pissinou, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 5 more authors" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '5 more authors' ?

However, traditional digital forensic techniques are primarily based on manual labor-intensive processes, which become increasingly insufficient with the rapid growth and complexity of digital data. To this end, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools capable of automating and enhancing various digital forensic tasks, significantly transforming the field. Despite the strides made, general practitioners and forensic experts often lack a comprehensive understanding of the capabilities, principles, and limitations of LLM, which limits the full potential of LLM in forensic applications. To fill this gap, this paper aims to provide an accessible and systematic overview of how LLM has revolutionized the digital forensics approach. Specifically, it takes a look at the basic concepts of digital forensics, as well as the evolution of LLM, and emphasizes the superior capabilities of LLM. To connect theory and practice, relevant examples and real-world scenarios are discussed. We also critically analyze the current limitations of applying LLMs to digital forensics, including issues related to illusion, interpretability, bias, and ethical considerations. In addition, this paper outlines the prospects for future research, highlighting the need for effective use of LLMs for transparency, accountability, and robust standardization in the forensic process.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div id="amon2025uncertain" class="col-sm-10"> <div class="title">Uncertain boundaries: Multidisciplinary approaches to copyright issues in generative ai</div> <div class="author"> Archer Amon, <em>Zhipeng Yin</em>, Zichong Wang, Avash Palikhe, Tongjia Yu, and Wenbin Zhang </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>ACM SIGKDD Explorations Newsletter</em>, 2025 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.08221" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HTML</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Generative AI is becoming increasingly prevalent in creative f ields, sparking urgent debates over how current copyright laws can keep pace with technological innovation. Recent controversies of AI models generating near-replicas of copyrighted material highlight the need to adapt current legal frameworks and develop technical methods to mitigate copyright infringement risks. This task requires understanding the intersection between computational concepts such as large-scale data scraping and probabilistic content generation, legal definitions of originality and fair use, and economic impacts on intellectual property (IP) rights holders. However, most existing research on copyright in AI takes a purely computer science or law-based approach, leaving a gap in coordinating these approaches that only multidisciplinary efforts can effectively address. To bridge this gap, our survey adopts a comprehensive approach synthesizing insights from law, policy, economics, and computer science. It begins by discussing the foundational goals and considerations that should be applied to copyright in generative AI, followed by methods for detecting and assessing potential violations in AI system outputs. Next, it explores various regulatory options influenced by legal, policy, and economic frameworks to manage and mitigate copyright concerns associated with generative AI and reconcile the interests of IP rights holders with that of generative AI producers. The discussion then introduces techniques to safeguard individual creative works from unauthorized replication, such as watermarking and cryptographic protections. Finally, it describes advanced training strategies designed to prevent AI models from reproducing protected content. In doing so, we highlight key opportunities for action and offer actionable strategies that creators, developers, and policymakers can use in navigating the evolving copyright landscape.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div id="wang2025graph" class="col-sm-10"> <div class="title">Graph fairness via authentic counterfactuals: Tackling structural and causal challenges</div> <div class="author"> Zichong Wang, <em>Zhipeng Yin</em>, Fang Liu, Zhen Liu, Christine Lisetti, Rui Yu, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 5 more authors" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '5 more authors' ?

Various fair graph methods have thus been proposed, primarily relying on statistical fairness notions that emphasize sensitive attributes as a primary source of bias, leaving other sources of bias inadequately addressed. Existing works employ counterfactual fairness to tackle this issue from a causal perspective. However, these approaches suffer from two key limitations: they overlook hidden confounders that may affect node features and graph structure, leading to an oversimplification of causality and the inability to generate authentic counterfactual instances; they neglect graph structure bias, resulting in over-correlation of sensitive attributes with node representations. In response, this paper introduces the Authentic Graph Counterfactual Generator (AGCG), a novel framework designed to mitigate graph structure bias through a novel fair message-passing technique and to improve counterfactual sample generation by inferring hidden confounders. Comprising four key modules - subgraph selection, fair node aggregation, hidden confounder identification, and counterfactual instance generation - AGCG offers a holistic approach to advancing graph model fairness in multiple dimensions. Empirical studies conducted on both real and synthetic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and utility of AGCG in promoting fair graph-based decision-making.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">1950</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row"> <div id="einstein1950meaning" class="col-sm-10"> <div class="title">The meaning of relativity</div> <div class="author"> Albert Einstein and AH Taub </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>American Journal of Physics</em>, 1950 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="bibtex btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Bib</a> </div> <div class="bibtex hidden"> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bibtex" data-lang="bibtex"><span class="nc">@article</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">einstein1950meaning</span><span class="p">,</span>

A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> <h2 class="bibliography">1920</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row"> <div id="einstein1920relativity" class="col-sm-10"> <div class="title">Relativity: the Special and General Theory</div> <div class="author"> Albert Einstein </div> <div class="periodical"> 1920 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a href="/assets/html/relativity.html" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">HTML</a> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> <h2 class="bibliography">1905</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row"> <div id="einstein1905photoelectriceffect" class="col-sm-10"> <div class="title">Über einen die Erzeugung und Verwandlung des Lichtes betreffenden heuristischen Gesichtspunkt</div> <div class="author"> Albert Einstein </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Ann.
